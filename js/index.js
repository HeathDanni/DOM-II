// ### Task 2a: Create listeners for 10 types of events

// * [ ] Using your [index.js file](js/index.js), create [event listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) of at least 10 _different_ types. You must Use your creativity to make the Fun Bus site more interactive. For example you could change colors, animate objects, remove objects, etc. Here are some event types you could try to use:
//   * `mouseover`
//   * `keydown`
//   * `wheel`
//   * `load`
//   * `focus`
//   * `resize`
//   * `scroll`
//   * `select`
//   * `dblclick`
//   * `drag / drop`

// Note: Drag and drop is a bit more advanced than the others: it's not actually a single type of event but several types that need to work together.
